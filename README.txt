Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
We create a Decision Tree Classifier, if we feed any new data to this classifier it would predict the right class accordingly.
Decision Trees are versatile Machine Learning algorithms that can perform both classification and regression tasks, and even multioutput tasks.For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, the Decision Tree classifier has been created and visualized.
There is step by step explanation of the code in the code.ipynb file.
